# Analysis of Power Outage Data
This is a repository for my final project for DSC 80, taken during Fall 2025 at UCSD.
## Purpose
Over the course of this project, I will analyze the data on power outages by conducting EDA, hypothesis tests, and building a prediction model for the duration of outages.
